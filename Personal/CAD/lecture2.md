### Applying graph theory concepts to electric circuits
#### KCL
Incidence Matrix * Branch Currents = zero vector
#### KVL
Tie Set Matrix * Branch Voltages = zero vector

Apparently something is wrong with the relation between branch currents and loop currents.
Remember that B<sup>T</sup> is **NOT** B transpose. So what is it?

<!-- #### Relating branch and loop currents
Branch currents = sum of the loop currents that pass through that branch, or more concretely:<br>
Branch Currents = TieSetMatrix -->
